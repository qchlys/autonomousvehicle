				<p class="i1">Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use technology to partially or 
				   entirely replace the human driver in navigating a vehicle from an 
				   origin to a destination while avoiding road hazards and responding to 
				   traffic conditions.1 The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed 
				   a widely-adopted classification system with six levels based on the level of 
				   human intervention. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
				   uses this classification system.

				<p class="i1">AV research started in the 1980s when universities began
				working on two types of AVs: one that required roadway infrastructure and 
				one that did not.1 The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
				has held “grand challenges” testing the performance of AVs on a 150-mile off-road 
				course.1 No vehicles successfully finished the 2004 Grand Challenge, but five completed 
				the course in 2005.1 In 2007, six teams finished the third DARPA challenge, which consisted 
				of a 60-mile course navigating an urban environment obeying normal traffic laws.1 In 2015, 
				the University of Michigan built Mcity, the first testing facility built for autonomous vehicles. 
				Research is conducted there into the safety, efficiency, accessibility, and commercial viability of AVs.
				4 Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, are being developed for commercial ventures such as
				last-mile package delivery, medical supply transportation, and inspection of critical infrastructure.

				<p class="cmps">Audi is the first to test autonomous vehicles in New York
				   In May of this year, the state of New York opened up an application 
				   process for companies that wanted to test autonomous vehicles there. 
				   Audi snagged the first license and will begin testing near Albany in the coming weeks.
				   The Audi A7 that will do the first demo at the New York state capital is not new to 
				   the company’s fleet of autonomous test cars. With licenses to test in Nevada and 
				   California, Audi has already put thousands of miles on this test car’s odometer, 
				   according to a press release. The A7 is set up to perform SAE Level 3 autonomous driving 
				   tasks, which means it can drive unassisted at posted highway speeds when conditions are good. 
				   So no speeding, no snow, and a driver does still need to be behind the wheel and ready to take 
				   over when prompted.

				<h2>BMW</h2><br>

				<p class="cmps">
				   The age of autonomous driving is rapidly approaching. 
				   BMW is the latest carmaker to invest in a testing ground for the technology. 
				   Located in Sokolov, Czech Republic, the German brand has unveiled the first of 
				   two proposed €300 million track sections for testing electrification, digitalisation, 
				   and automated driving. Dubbed the New Technology Area, all aspects of autonomous driving 
				   will be tested at the 90,000m² site, spanning testing assistance systems and behaviour in 
				   cross traffic, as well as emergency braking and evasive situations. Testing will be prepared 
				   and controlled from the adjoining control room with temporary workstations. Central to the 
				   make-up of the site is a 6km motorway-style circuit with on- and off-ramp scenarios.

				<h2>Ford</h2><br>
				<img class="comps" src="ford.jpg">
				<p class="cmps">
				Ford plans to release a test self-driving car by 2022! This news comes as a 
				surprise as the company has been lagging behind its competitors when it comes to autonomous technology.
				The Ford Motor Company has announced that it intends to release a fully autonomous vehicle within the 
				next five years. The car, which will be available for both public and commercial use, will be part 
				of the company’s larger push to invest in and develop self-driving technology.
				Ford plans to release autonomous test vehicles by the end of 2022. The company has been 
				testing self-driving cars for years and is now confident that the technology is ready for 
				mass production. Ford’s goal is to have a fully autonomous car on the market within five years, 
				and it is investing heavily in the development of self-driving technology. The company has already
				partnered with several tech companies and startups to create a self-driving ecosystem.

				<h2>Tesla</h2><br>
				<img class="comps" src="tesla.png">
				<p class="cmps">
				Tesla is aiming to have its self-driving technology ready by the end of the year, with the goal of rolling it out in the United States and possibly Europe.
				That’s according to the company’s CEO Elon Musk, who told an energy conference one of his current priorities was getting Tesla cars “to be able to do self-driving” by the end of the year.
				Tesla’s “full self-driving” (FSD) mode has been in testing since 2020, while features listed under its “Autopilot” technology have already been in use since 2015.
				Autopilot includes features such as traffic-aware cruise control, autosteer when in clearly marked lanes, and automatic parking.
				Full self-driving mode means the features of Autopilot, plus the ability for the car to drive through city streets, identifying stop signs and traffic lights, “with your active supervision”.
